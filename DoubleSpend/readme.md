# Bitcoin Double-Spend Attack Analysis with GPU Acceleration

## üéØ Overview

This project implements a comprehensive analysis of double-spend attack probabilities in Bitcoin and other proof-of-work cryptocurrencies. It combines theoretical analysis based on Satoshi Nakamoto's original Bitcoin whitepaper with GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulations to validate the mathematical model and provide economic insights.

## üìö Background

### What is a Double-Spend Attack?

A double-spend attack is a potential security threat in cryptocurrency networks where an attacker attempts to spend the same coins twice by:

1. **Creating a transaction** sending coins to a merchant/victim
2. **Waiting for confirmations** until the merchant accepts the payment
3. **Mining a secret chain** that doesn't include the original transaction
4. **Broadcasting the longer chain** to reverse the transaction and reclaim the coins

### The Role of Confirmations

In Bitcoin, each "confirmation" represents a new block added to the blockchain after your transaction. The more confirmations, the harder it becomes for an attacker to reverse the transaction. The standard is:
- **0 confirmations**: Transaction broadcast but not yet in a block (very risky)
- **1 confirmation**: Transaction included in the latest block
- **3 confirmations**: Standard for low-value transactions
- **6 confirmations**: Bitcoin standard for exchanges (about 60 minutes)
- **100 confirmations**: Required for coinbase (mining reward) maturity

## üî¨ Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. **Nakamoto's Analytical Formula**
```python
P_attack = 1 - Œ£(k=0 to z) [Poisson(k; Œª) * (1 - (q/p)^(z-k))]
```
Where:
- `q` = Attacker's fraction of total network hash power
- `p` = Honest miners' fraction (1-q)
- `z` = Number of confirmations
- `Œª` = z * (q/p)` = Expected attacker progress

#### 2. **GPU-Accelerated Monte Carlo Simulation**
- Simulates millions of attack scenarios in parallel using CuPy
- Each trial models a race between honest chain and attacker's secret chain
- Validates analytical results through empirical simulation

#### 3. **Economic Analysis**
Calculates:
- **Attack cost**: Opportunity cost of mining on attack chain
- **Break-even value**: Minimum transaction value to make attack profitable
- **ROI**: Return on investment for various attack scenarios

### Customization

#### Modify Attack Scenarios

# In main() function:
qs = [0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, 0.45]  # Attacker hash power

N = 1_000_000  # Number of Monte Carlo trials
```

#### Adjust Economic Parameters
```python
# In calculate_economic_metrics():
block_reward = 6.25  # Current Bitcoin block reward
tx_value = 1000  # Transaction value in BTC
```

## üìà Key Insights from Analysis

### Security Thresholds
- **10% attacker**: 6 confirmations ‚Üí ~0.0024% success rate
- **25% attacker**: 6 confirmations ‚Üí ~13.2% success rate  
- **40% attacker**: 6 confirmations ‚Üí ~49.3% success rate

### Economic Implications
- Small attackers (<10% hash power) face prohibitive costs for attacks
- Attacks become economically viable only for very large transactions
- Network security increases exponentially with confirmations

### Practical Recommendations
1. **Micro-transactions** (<$100): 1 confirmation usually sufficient
2. **Regular transactions** ($100-$10,000): 3-6 confirmations recommended
3. **High-value transfers** (>$10,000): Wait for 10+ confirmations
4. **Exchange deposits**: Industry standard of 6 confirmations is reasonable

## üîç Mathematical Details

### Poisson Distribution Application
The analysis uses the Poisson distribution to model the number of blocks an attacker might mine while the honest chain grows by k blocks. This assumes:
- Constant hash rate over time
- Memoryless mining process (exponential inter-block times)
- Independent block discoveries

### Assumptions and Limitations
1. **Constant hash power**: Assumes attacker maintains constant fraction q
2. **No network effects**: Ignores propagation delays and orphan blocks
3. **Rational attacker**: Assumes profit-maximizing behavior
4. **No eclipse attacks**: Assumes victim sees the true longest chain
5. **Fixed block rewards**: Doesn't account for fee variations

## üéì Educational Value

This analysis helps understand:
- **Blockchain security fundamentals**
- **Trade-offs between speed and security**
- **Economic game theory in cryptocurrencies**
- **Importance of decentralization** (resistance to 51% attacks)
- **GPU programming for financial simulations**

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. **CUDA/CuPy Installation Issues**

# If CuPy fails to install, try:
pip install cupy-cuda11x  # For CUDA 11.x
# Or for CPU-only version, modify code to use NumPy:
# Replace: import cupy as cp
# With: import numpy as cp
```

#### 2. **Memory Errors**
- Reduce `N` (number of simulations) if GPU runs out of memory
- Split large simulations into batches
- Use system RAM with NumPy for very large simulations

import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('Agg')  # For headless systems
```
